(Version 1.0)
Overview
This folder contains primary output objects and summary figures derived from the fitted Royle–Nichols multi-species occupancy model (MSOM) used in this study.
Files in this directory represent:
•	finalized model objects,
•	posterior summaries,
•	coefficient and effect plots for occupancy (ψ) and detection (p),
and correspond directly to results reported in the main text and supplementary materials.
These outputs were generated using scripts documented in the /code directory.

File Inventory & Roles
1. Fitted Model Objects
mod.jagsT18_2.rds
Type: R S4 model object
Description:
Saved JAGS model specification object used to fit the final MSOM, including priors, hierarchical structure, and derived parameters. Created directly from package camtrapR communitymodel function before having the model text and parameters monitored edited for final MSOM specifications.
Role in analysis:
Provides the exact statistical model and data package used by the JAGs MSOM and enables re-running diagnostics or posterior summaries without redefining the model structure.
________________________________________
fit.jagsT18_2.rds
Type: R fitted model output
Description:
Posterior samples from the fitted MSOM, including species-level and community-level parameters, latent states, and derived quantities.
Role in analysis:
Primary source for all numerical inference, effect size estimation, uncertainty quantification, and downstream visualization.

2. Occupancy (ψ) Results
MSOM_T18_2_OccCoefPlots.pdf
Type: PDF figure
Description:
Plots showing species-level and community-level occupancy (ψ) coefficients for modeled site covariates.
Role in analysis:
Used to summarize the direction, magnitude, and uncertainty of covariate effects on occupancy probability.
________________________________________
MSOM_T18_2_OccCoefPlot_Combined.pdf
Type: PDF figure
Description:
Combined coefficient plot aggregating all occupancy covariates and species into a single visualization for comparative interpretation.
Role in analysis:
Provides a compact overview of occupancy responses across species and covariates.
________________________________________
MSOM_T18_2_OccEffectPlots.pdf
Type: PDF figure
Description:
Marginal effect plots illustrating predicted occupancy probability (ψ) across observed ranges of site covariates, with posterior uncertainty.
Role in analysis:
Supports interpretation of non-linear and scaled effects reported in the Results section.
________________________________________
3. Detection (p) Results
MSOM_T18_2_DetCoefPlots.pdf
Type: PDF figure
Description:
Coefficient plots summarizing species-level detection (p) effects for observation- and site-level covariates.
Role in analysis:
Used to assess heterogeneity in detection probability and evaluate the influence of sampling and anthropogenic covariates.
________________________________________
MSOM_T18_2_DetEffectPlots.pdf
Type: PDF figure
Description:
Marginal effect plots showing predicted detection probability (p) across covariate gradients, including seasonality and effort-related variables.
Role in analysis:
Provides visual support for detection submodel results and complements numerical summaries.

Relationship to Manuscript Figures
•	Main-text figures are derived directly from these outputs or regenerated using the same posterior samples.
•	Supplementary figures correspond exactly to the PDF files provided here unless otherwise noted in the manuscript.
•	No additional post-processing was applied outside the documented code pipeline.
________________________________________
Reproducibility Notes
•	All figures can be regenerated by loading fit.jagsT18_2.rds and running the plotting scripts in the code subfolder.
•	Numerical values shown in plots reflect posterior means and credible intervals as defined in the Methods.
•	Minor aesthetic differences may occur across systems due to plotting device settings and camtrapR version in use.
________________________________________
Scope & Limitations
•	This folder contains summary outputs only; raw posterior chains and intermediate diagnostics are stored within the .rds objects.
•	Spatial projection outputs are documented separately in their respective results directories.
