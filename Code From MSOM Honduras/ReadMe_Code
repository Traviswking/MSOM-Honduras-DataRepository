(Version 1.0)
Overview
This folder contains all R scripts and model specification files used to fit, evaluate, and visualize the Royle–Nichols multi-species occupancy models (MSOMs) and associated spatial projections and trait-based analyses for this study.
The code is organized to reflect the logical workflow of the analysis, from data assembly and model fitting to post-processing, visualization, and spatial prediction.
All scripts were developed and executed in R, using camtrapR and rjags for Bayesian model fitting.

File Inventory & Roles
1. Core Model Construction & Execution
MSOM_Honduras_18_2_fullrun_Rcode.txt
Purpose:
End-to-end R script that:
•	assembles detection histories and covariates,
•	constructs the Royle–Nichols MSOM using camtrapR,
•	executes the full JAGS model run,
•	saves posterior samples and diagnostic outputs,
•	generates initial coefficient plots and summary tables.
Notes:
This script defines the primary statistical model used in the manuscript and represents the authoritative implementation of the MSOM analysis.
________________________________________
MSOM_T18_2.R
Purpose:
Standalone R script for:
•	loading the prepared MSOM data object,
•	running the JAGS model with finalized MCMC settings,
•	saving posterior samples and diagnostics,
•	exporting summary statistics and effect plots.
Notes:
This script isolates the model fitting and diagnostics phase, facilitating reproducibility and reruns without re-assembling the full data package. Initially used for the Kamiak HPC model run which requires shell script run in bash.
________________________________________
MSOM_T18_ModelText_2.txt
Purpose:
JAGS model specification file defining:
•	community-level priors,
•	species-level random effects,
•	occupancy and detection submodels,
•	Bayesian goodness-of-fit diagnostics,
•	derived quantities (e.g., mean occupancy and detection).
Notes:
This file contains the formal statistical model text referenced in the Methods and Supplementary Materials.

2. Spatial Prediction & Raster Outputs
MSOM_Honduras_18_2_Species_Spatial_Projections.txt
Purpose:
Generates spatial predictions of:
•	species-specific occupancy probability
•	community-level species richness,
using fitted MSOM outputs and scaled landscape covariate rasters.
Outputs include:
•	GeoTIFF layers of mean and uncertainty,
•	PDF maps for visual inspection.
Notes:
This script underlies all spatial projections and maps presented in the manuscript.

3. Trait-Based Post-Hoc Analyses & Visualization
MSOM_Honduras_Graphing_SppTraits_FullAnalysisCode.txt
Purpose:
Post-processing of MSOM posterior samples to:
•	link species-level responses to ecological traits,
•	generate ridge plots and forest plots,
•	compute group-level contrasts and posterior overlap,
•	export summary tables of significant differences.
Notes:
This script supports trait-based inference and secondary analyses reported in the Results.

Expected Inputs
Scripts in this folder assume the presence of:
•	processed detection histories,
•	site-level covariate tables,
•	(for spatial projections) pre-aligned raster covariates.
Input data files are described in the /data directory README and are not duplicated here.
________________________________________
Expected Outputs
Depending on the script executed, outputs may include:
•	.rds objects containing fitted model results,
•	.csv summary tables,
•	.pdf diagnostic and effect plots,
•	.tif raster layers of predicted occupancy and richness.
All outputs are either regenerated dynamically or saved to designated output directories documented elsewhere in the repository.
________________________________________
Reproducibility Notes
•	Random seeds should be set explicitly if exact numerical replication is required.
•	Full model runs are computationally intensive and may require HPC resources.
•	Note Primary coding pieces are here for core portions of the analysis but if you have any questions or are missing a portion of code for a minor step please contact the primary author happy to help.
